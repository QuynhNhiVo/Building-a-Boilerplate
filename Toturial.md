# Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate

> Welcome to the Introduction to Bash lessons. I know it's scary, but you can do this!

## 5. Restart Terminal

### 5.1

**The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.** Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo hello terminal` into the terminal and press enter.

#### HINTS

- Capitalization matters
- If the tests don't run automatically, try typing `exit` into the terminal and redoing the instructions

## 10. Print Working Directory

### 10.1

What you see in the terminal below is a folder (or directory) on this machine. Type `pwd` into the terminal and press enter to see the path of the folder. `pwd` stands for "print working directory".

#### HINTS

- Type `pwd` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the `project` folder if you aren't there

## 20. List

### 20.1

The output tells you where the folder you are in is located. You are in the `project` folder, which is in the `CodeAlly` folder, which is in the `home` folder. Type `ls` into the terminal to see what's in this folder. `ls` stands for "list".

#### HINTS

- Type `ls` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in the `project` folder when you enter the command
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the `project` folder if you aren't there

## 30. Change Directory

### 30.1

The output is showing everything in this folder. There's two folders here. You can use `cd <folder_name>` to go into a folder. `cd` stands for "change directory". Change to the `freeCodeCamp` directory.

#### HINTS

- Capitalization matters
- Type `cd freeCodeCamp` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you start in the `project` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project` to get to the `project` folder if you aren't there

## 40. Print Working Directory

### 40.1

You are in the `freecodecamp` folder now. You may have noticed that the prompt changed to include it. Print the working directory of the `freeCodeCamp` folder to see the full path of where you are.

#### HINTS

- Use the "print working directory" command
- Type `pwd` into the terminal and press enter
- Make sure you are in the `freeCodeCamp` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project/freeCodeCamp` to get to the `freeCodeCamp` folder if you aren't there

## 50. List

### 50.1

You can see the path of the `freeCodeCamp` folder. It's in the `project` folder you were just in. List the contents of the `freeCodeCamp` folder to see what's here.

#### HINTS

- Use the "list" command
- Try typing `ls` into the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `freeCodeCamp` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project/freeCodeCamp` to get to the `freeCodeCamp` folder if you aren't there

## 60. Change Directory

### 60.1

There's two folders and three files here. The folders are blue and the files include their extension. Next, change to that `test` directory.

#### HINTS

- Use the "change directory" command
- Here's an example: `cd folder-name`
- Try entering `cd test`
- Make sure you enter the command from the `freeCodeCamp` folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/freeCodeCamp` to get to the `freeCodeCamp` folder if you aren't there

## 70. Print Working Directory

### 70.1

You can see you are in the `test` folder now. It shows `test` in the prompt. Print the full path of this directory. Remember that "folder" and "directory" are the same thing.

#### HINTS

- Use the "print working directory" command
- Type `pwd` into the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `test` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project/freeCodeCamp/test` to get to the `test` folder if you aren't there

## 80. List

### 80.1

- Enter `cd ~/project/freeCodeCamp/test` to get to the `test` folder if you aren't there

## 90. Change Directory

### 90.1

These are all files. There's no more folders to go into here. You can use `cd ..` to go back a folder level. The two dots will take you back one level. Go back to the `freeCodeCamp` folder.

#### HINTS

- Use the "change directory" command
- Type `cd ..` into the terminal end press enter
- Type the command from the `test` folder
- Enter `cd ~/project/freeCodeCamp/test` to get to the `test` folder if you aren't there

### 100.1

`test` got removed from the prompt since you left that folder and you're back in the `freeCodeCamp` folder. List the contents of what's here to remind yourself.

#### HINTS

- Use the "list" command
- Type `ls` into the terminal
- Make sure you are in the `freeCodeCamp` folder first

## 110. More

### 110.1

There's the `test` folder you were just in. You can see what's in a file with `more <filename>`. Use it to view what's in the `package.json` file.

#### HINTS

- Type `more package.json` into the terminal
- Press enter until you have seen the whole file
- Make sure you are in the `freeCodeCamp` folder first
- Enter `cd ~/project/freeCodeCamp` to get to the `freeCodeCamp` folder if you aren't there

## 120. Clear

## 160. Long List Format

### 160.1

That's a lot of folders. You can add a **flag** to a command to use it different ways like this: `ls <flag>`. List the contents of the `node_modules` folder in "long list format". Do that by adding the `-l` flag to the "list" command.

#### HINTS

- Use the "list" command
- Add the `-l` flag to the command
- That's a lowercase letter `l`, not the number `1`
- Enter `ls -l` into the terminal

## 310. Echo

### 310.1

It's brand new, there's nothing in it yet. The `echo` command lets you print anything to the terminal. You used it in the first lesson. Just type what you want to print after it. Use it to print `hello website` to the terminal.

## 410. Touch

You didn't go anywhere. The `.` takes you to the folder you are in, and `..` takes you back, or up, a folder. Websites need some images. Create `background.jpg` in the `website` folder.
